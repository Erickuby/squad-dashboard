# YouTube Video Script: Prompt Engineering for BTNE
## 10-Minute Video | 1,600-1,800 Words

---

### [0:00-0:30] HOOK - THE GAME CHANGER
**Visual:** Dramatic camera close-up. Energetic music starts. Bold text overlay: "250% GROWTH"
**Audio:** Upbeat, building anticipation

**Script:**
In 2025, demand for prompt engineering skills increased by 250%. But most of us are still struggling to write basic prompts. Today, I'm going to show you 3 techniques that transformed my career from overwhelmed to empowered.

**Visual:** Camera zooms out. Host sitting comfortably. Warm lighting.

I used to stare at my screen, frustrated. AI wasn't helping. It was hurting. I'd type something like "help me with code" and get garbage back. Or "fix my resume" and end up with something worse than I started.

---

### [0:30-1:00] THE STRUGGLE IS REAL
**Visual:** Host walking through space. Casual, natural movement.

**Script:**
Let me guess. You've tried ChatGPT. Maybe Claude. You typed some questions. Got okay answers. Nothing mind-blowing. You figured "this is it." This is as good as it gets.

**Visual:** Screen recording of generic AI conversation. Mediocre response.

You're not alone. Most of us in BTNE started there. We heard the hype. Tried to tools. Got underwhelmed. Moved on with our lives.

**Visual:** Host back at desk. Serious expression.

But here's the truth. The difference between average results and game-changing results? It's not a tool. It's not a model. It's how you talk to it.

---

### [1:00-1:30] WHY THIS MATTERS NOW
**Visual:** Host back on camera. Dynamic energy.

**Script:**
Companies are scrambling for people who can actually work with AI. Not just use it casually. But really work with it.

**Visual:** Infographic: "68% Productivity Boost" with upward arrow graphic.

Studies show professionals who master prompt engineering are 68% more productive. That's not a small number. That's doing in 3 hours what used to take 8 hours.

And money? People with these skills earn 23% more on average. In our community, where we're already fighting for every opportunity? This is leverage. Pure and simple.

---

### [1:30-2:00] THE TRANSFORMATION
**Visual:** Host sharing personal story moment. Intimate camera angle.

**Script:**
Three months ago, I couldn't get ChatGPT to write a decent email. Now? I use AI to debug complex code, optimize my LinkedIn strategy, even prepare for salary negotiations.

**Visual:** Before/after comparison. Left: Frustrated at computer. Right: Confident, in control.

The difference wasn't learning new tech. It was learning three simple techniques. Techniques I'm about to teach you. No jargon. No complicated frameworks. Just practical stuff you can use today.

**Visual:** Split screen showing diverse BTNE professionals. Smiling, confident.

This isn't just about coding. It's about everything. Writing emails. Preparing for interviews. Analyzing data. Creating content. Debugging problems. The applications are endless.

---

### [2:00-2:30] TECHNIQUE #1: FEW-SHOT PROMPTING
**Visual:** Host with props. Maybe examples on a board.

**Script:**
First up: Few-shot prompting. Sounds technical, right? It's actually the opposite. It's the most natural thing in the world.

**Visual:** Screen recording showing the concept.

Think about the last time someone taught you something. Did they just explain? Or did they show you examples? We learn from examples. Always have. AI is no different.

**Visual:** Animated comparison. Left: "Write a LinkedIn post." Right: "Write a LinkedIn post like this..." with 3 examples.

Instead of asking AI to "write me an email," show it what you want. Give it 2-3 examples of your style. The tone you like. The structure you prefer.

**Visual:** Host with a concrete example on screen.

Now with few-shot: "Write a follow-up email after a job interview. Here's my style from previous emails..." and I paste 3 examples. Boom. Different game entirely.

**Visual:** Second example appears. Much better email. Personal, professional, matches your voice.

**Visual:** Host leaning in, sharing a secret.

The magic is in the examples. Show, don't just tell. Your AI will thank you. And your results will show it.

---

### [2:30-3:00] FEW-SHOT IN ACTION
**Visual:** Real demonstration on screen.

**Script:**
Let me show you exactly how this works with something we all do: responding to messages. Maybe on LinkedIn, maybe WhatsApp, maybe email.

**Visual:** Host typing on laptop.

I'll open ChatGPT. I'll say: "I need to respond to this recruiter message professionally but casually. Here's the message they sent: [paste]."

**Visual:** Message appears on screen.

Then I'll add: "Here are 3 examples of how I typically respond: [paste 3 examples of my past responses]. Notice the tone—friendly but professional, concise, I always include next steps."

**Visual:** Host with emphasis.

The magic is in the examples. Show, don't just tell. Your AI will thank you. And your results will show it.

---

### [3:00-3:30] TECHNIQUE #2: CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT
**Visual:** Host with a thinking expression. Maybe a lightbulb graphic.

**Script:**
Second technique: Chain-of-thought. This one changed everything for me. Especially when dealing with complex problems.

**Visual:** Animated flowchart showing a problem breaking into steps.

We don't solve big problems in one leap. We break them down. Step by step. We think through options. We test approaches. We iterate.

**Visual:** Screen recording showing a bad prompt.

"Debug this code." Simple prompt. The AI might give you a fix. But it won't explain why. You won't learn anything. And if it's wrong? You're stuck.

**Visual:** Screen recording showing a good prompt with chain-of-thought.

Now try this: "Debug this code. First, analyze what the code is supposed to do. Second, identify potential issues. Third, walk through each line systematically. Finally, provide a fix and explain your reasoning."

**Visual:** Animated breakdown of the steps.

See what happened? We asked AI to show its work. To think out loud. To explain each step. The result isn't just a solution. It's understanding.

---

### [3:30-4:00] CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT FOR NON-TECHNICAL
**Visual:** Host with a more casual vibe.

**Script:**
You don't have to be technical to use this. Let's say you're preparing for a job interview. A big one. You're nervous. You want to be ready.

**Visual:** Screen showing a bad prompt.

"Help me prepare for this job interview." Too vague. You'll get generic tips. Stuff you could find anywhere.

**Visual:** Screen recording showing a chain-of-thought prompt.

Now try chain-of-thought: "I have a job interview next week for [role]. First, analyze the job description and identify 5 key skills they're looking for. Second, for each skill, generate 3 practice questions they might ask. Third, outline how I'd answer each question using my experience. Finally, help me practice by simulating the interview."

**Visual:** Animated breakdown showing each step.

See what happened? We didn't just ask for feedback. We prepared strategically. We thought through the process. We'll walk into that interview with confidence because we've done the work.

---

### [4:00-4:30] CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT IN ACTION
**Visual:** Animated graphic showing improvement over time.

The magic is in the examples. Show, don't just tell. Your AI will thank you. And your results will show it.

That's few-shot prompting in action. You're not just asking. You're teaching. And that teaching compounds. The more you use it, the better it gets at your style.

---

### [4:30-5:00] ROLE-BASED PROMPTING
**Visual:** Host with dramatic flair. Maybe wearing different hats or changing position.

**Script:**
Third technique: Role-based prompting. This is where the fun starts. AI can be anyone you want it to be. Literally.

**Visual:** Animated transformation. AI icon changing into different personas.

Want feedback on your resume from a hiring manager? Ask AI to act as one. Need help negotiating salary? Ask it to be a career coach. Preparing for a technical interview? Have it play the interviewer.

**Visual:** Screen recording showing a role-based prompt.

"You are a senior hiring manager at a Fortune 500 tech company. Review my resume and provide feedback. Focus on what stands out positively, what needs improvement, and how I can position myself for higher-level roles."

**Visual:** Response appears on screen. Professional, detailed feedback.

See what happened? You didn't just ask for feedback. You created a persona. Someone specific. Someone with expertise. And that changes everything.

**Visual:** Host leaning in, engaged.

**Visual:** Animated graphic showing different roles.

---

### [5:00-5:30] ROLE-BASED IN ACTION
**Visual:** Host with enthusiasm.

**Script:**
Let me show you something I use constantly. As someone in tech, I'm always learning new things. Sometimes I need to understand a concept quickly. Deeply.

**Visual:** Screen showing a complex technical topic.

I'll say: "You are an expert technical educator who specializes in explaining complex concepts to beginners. Explain [concept] to me as if I'm 10 years old. Use analogies. Avoid jargon. Then give me a follow-up explanation as if I'm a college student. Finally, provide a technical summary for reference."

**Visual:** Three-tiered response appears on screen.

What do I get? Three explanations at different depths. I can start simple and go deeper as I understand. No googling. No confusion. Just clear, layered learning.

---

### [5:30-6:00] ROLE-BASED FOR EVERYTHING
**Visual:** Host with aha moment.

**Script:**
This works for everything. Legal documents. Financial planning. Project management. Whatever domain you need, AI can step into that role. But you have to ask.

**Visual:** Host with emphasis.

The specificity matters. "You are a..." followed by expertise, audience, and context. That's the formula. Simple but powerful.

**Visual:** Animated formula appears on screen: "You are a [role] who [specialization]..."

---

### [6:00-8:00] ROLE-BASED IN ACTION
**Visual:** Host leaning in, engaged.

**Script:**
The specificity matters. "You are a [role] who [specialization]..." followed by expertise, audience, and context.

### [9:30-10:00] CONCLUSION & CTA
**Visual:** Host back on camera. Direct eye contact. Warm lighting.

**Script:**
Whether you're technical or not. Entry-level or senior. This skill levels the playing field. And that's exactly why I'm sharing this today.

Three techniques. That's it. But here's what I want you to understand. These aren't just prompt tips. They're communication skills. Skills that will serve you everywhere. Not just with AI.

**Visual:** Animated graphic showing different roles.

This isn't just about coding. It's about everything. Writing emails. Preparing for interviews. Analyzing data. Creating content. Debugging problems. The applications are endless.
