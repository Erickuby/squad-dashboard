### [0:00-0:30] HOOK - THE GAME CHANGER
**Visual:** Dramatic camera close-up. Energetic music starts. Bold text overlay: "250% GROWTH"
**Audio:** Upbeat, building anticipation

**Script:**
In 2025, demand for prompt engineering skills increased by 250%. But most of us are still struggling to write basic prompts. Today, I'm going to show you 3 techniques that transformed my career from overwhelmed to empowered.

**Visual:** Camera zooms out. Host sitting comfortably. Warm lighting.

I used to stare at my screen, frustrated. AI wasn't helping. It was hurting. I'd type something like "help me with code" and get garbage back. Or "fix my resume" and end up with something worse than I started.

---

### [0:30-1:00] THE STRUGGLE IS REAL
**Visual:** Host walking through space. Casual, natural movement.

**Script:**
Let me guess. You've tried ChatGPT. Maybe Claude. You typed some questions. Got okay answers. Nothing mind-blowing. You figured "this is it." This is as good as it gets.

**Visual:** Screen recording of generic AI conversation. Mediocre response.

You're not alone. Most of us in BTNE started there. We heard the hype. Tried the tools. Got underwhelmed. Moved on with our lives.

**Visual:** Host back at desk. Serious expression.

But here's the truth. The difference between average results and game-changing results? It's not the tool. It's not the model. It's how you talk to it.

---

### [1:00-1:30] WHY THIS MATTERS NOW
**Visual:** Host back on camera. Dynamic energy.

**Script:**
Companies are scrambling for people who can actually work with AI. Not just use it casually. But really work with it.

**Visual:** Infographic: "68% Productivity Boost" with upward arrow graphic.

Studies show professionals who master prompt engineering are 68% more productive. That's not a small number. That's doing in 3 hours what used to take 8 hours.

And money? People with these skills earn 23% more on average. In our community, where we're already fighting for every opportunity? This is leverage. Pure and simple.

---

### [1:30-2:00] THE TRANSFORMATION
**Visual:** Host sharing personal story moment. Intimate camera angle.

**Script:**
Three months ago, I couldn't get ChatGPT to write a decent email. Now? I use AI to debug complex code, optimize my LinkedIn strategy, even prepare for salary negotiations.

**Visual:** Before/after comparison. Left: Frustrated at computer. Right: Confident, in control.

The difference wasn't learning new tech. It was learning three simple techniques. Techniques I'm about to teach you. No jargon. No complicated frameworks. Just practical stuff you can use today.

**Visual:** Split screen showing diverse BTNE professionals. Smiling, confident.

This isn't just about coding. It's about everything. Writing emails. Preparing for interviews. Analyzing data. Creating content. Debugging problems. The applications are endless.

---

### [2:00-2:30] TECHNIQUE #1: FEW-SHOT PROMPTING
**Visual:** Host with props. Maybe examples on a board.

**Script:**
First up: Few-shot prompting. Sounds technical, right? It's actually the opposite. It's the most natural thing in the world.

**Visual:** Screen recording showing the concept.

Think about the last time someone taught you something. Did they just explain? Or did they show you examples? We learn from examples. Always have. AI is no different.

**Visual:** Animated comparison. Left: "Write a LinkedIn post." Right: "Write a LinkedIn post like this..." with 3 examples.

Instead of asking AI to "write me an email," show it what you want. Give it 2-3 examples of your style. The tone you like. The structure you prefer.

**Visual:** Host with a concrete example on screen.

Now with few-shot: "Write a follow-up email after a job interview. Here's my style from previous emails..." and I paste 3 examples. Boom. Different game entirely.

**Visual:** Second example appears. Much better email. Personal, professional, matches your voice.

**Visual:** Host leaning in, sharing a secret.

The magic is in the examples. Show, don't just tell. Your AI will thank you. And your results will show it.

---

### [2:30-3:00] FEW-SHOT IN ACTION
**Visual:** Real demonstration on screen.

**Script:**
Let me show you exactly how this works with something we all do: responding to messages. Maybe on LinkedIn, maybe WhatsApp, maybe email.

**Visual:** Host typing on laptop.

I'll open ChatGPT. I'll say: "I need to respond to this recruiter message professionally but casually. Here's the message they sent: [paste]."

**Visual:** Message appears on screen.

Then I'll add: "Here are 3 examples of how I typically respond: [paste 3 examples of my past responses]. Notice the tone—friendly but professional, concise, I always include next steps."

**Visual:** Host with emphasis.

The magic is in the examples. Show, don't just tell. Your AI will thank you. And your results will show it.

---

### [3:00-3:30] TECHNIQUE #2: CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT
**Visual:** Host with a thinking expression. Maybe a lightbulb graphic.

**Script:**
Second technique: Chain-of-thought. This one changed everything for me. Especially when dealing with complex problems.

**Visual:** Animated flowchart showing a problem breaking into steps.

We don't solve big problems in one leap. We break them down. Step by step. We think through options. We test approaches. We iterate.

**Visual:** Screen recording showing a bad prompt.

"Debug this code." Simple prompt. The AI might give you a fix. But it won't explain why. You won't learn anything. And if it's wrong? You're stuck.

**Visual:** Screen recording showing a good prompt with chain-of-thought.

Now try this: "Debug this code. First, analyze what the code is supposed to do. Second, identify potential issues. Third, walk through each line systematically. Finally, provide a fix and explain your reasoning."

**Visual:** Animated breakdown of the steps.

See what happened? We asked AI to show its work. To think out loud. To explain each step. The result isn't just a solution. It's understanding.

---

### [3:30-4:00] CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT FOR NON-TECHNICAL
**Visual:** Host with a more casual vibe.

**Script:**
You don't have to be technical to use this. Let's say you're preparing for a job interview. A big one. You're nervous. You want to be ready.

**Visual:** Screen showing a bad prompt.

"Help me prepare for this job interview." Too vague. You'll get generic tips. Stuff you could find anywhere.

**Visual:** Screen recording showing a chain-of-thought prompt.

Now try chain-of-thought: "I have a job interview next week for [role]. First, analyze the job description and identify 5 key skills they're looking for. Second, for each skill, generate 3 practice questions they might ask. Third, outline how I'd answer each question using my experience. Finally, help me practice by simulating the interview."

**Visual:** Animated breakdown showing each step.

See what happened? We didn't just ask for feedback. We prepared strategically. We thought through the process. We'll walk into that interview with confidence because we've done the work.

---

### [4:00-4:30] TECHNIQUE #3: ROLE-BASED PROMPTING
**Visual:** Host with dramatic flair. Maybe wearing different hats or changing position.

**Script:**
Third technique: Role-based prompting. This is where the fun starts. AI can be anyone you want it to be. Literally.

**Visual:** Animated transformation. AI icon changing into different personas.

Want feedback on your resume from a hiring manager? Ask AI to act as one. Need help negotiating salary? Ask it to be a career coach. Preparing for a technical interview? Have it play the interviewer.

**Visual:** Screen recording showing a role-based prompt.

"You are a senior hiring manager at a Fortune 500 tech company. Review my resume and provide feedback. Focus on what stands out positively, what needs improvement, and how I can position myself for higher-level roles."

**Visual:** Response appears on screen. Professional, detailed feedback.

See what happened? You didn't just ask for feedback. You created a persona. Someone specific. Someone with expertise. And that changes everything.

**Visual:** Host leaning in, engaged.

**Visual:** Animated graphic showing different roles.

---

### [4:30-5:00] THE CRAFT FRAMEWORK
**Visual:** Host with CRAFT framework infographic on screen.

**Script:**
Before I show you these techniques in action, I want to share something powerful. A framework that changed how I approach everything. It's called CRAFT.

**Visual:** CRAFT framework appears with 5 glowing neon cards against dark tech background.

**Visual:** C card appears first.

C stands for Context. Before you do anything with AI—or humans for that matter—you need to understand your environment. Who are you talking to? What's their background? What constraints are you working with?

Let me give you a real example. When I'm preparing to present to my manager about a new automation tool, I use CRAFT.

**Visual:** Host leans into camera.

First, I analyze the context. My manager is technical but focused on efficiency. She hates long meetings. She loves data. Time is always tight.

**Visual:** R card appears.

R is Role. Define your responsibility, function, and boundaries. My role in that meeting? Not just "present automation tool." It's "demonstrate efficiency impact with concrete data and get approval for pilot."

**Visual:** A card appears.

A is Action. Execute steps and behaviors to achieve objectives. I don't just talk. I prepare a demo. I gather usage metrics. I have a backup plan if she says no. I bring a one-page summary. Specific actions with clear outcomes.

**Visual:** F card appears.

F is Format. Structure communication using appropriate mediums and tools. Email? Keep it concise. Deck? Make it visual. Demo? Live and interactive. The right medium for the right message.

**Visual:** T card appears.

And T is Tone. Determine appropriate voice and emotional quality. Professional but not stiff. Confident but not arrogant. Data-driven but still human. Adapt to the room energy.

**Visual:** All 5 cards glowing together.

CRAFT changed everything. I used to ramble. Now I'm precise. I used to overwhelm people with options. Now I'm targeted. This framework works with AI too.

### [5:00-6:00] FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES IN ACTION
**Visual:** Host with energy, walking through examples.

**Script:**
Let me show you few-shot prompting in action with real BTNE scenarios.

**Visual:** Host at computer, screen visible.

Scenario one: You're a junior dev and you just got your code review feedback. It's... mixed. Some good points, some confusing comments. You want to thank your senior but also ask for clarification on the unclear parts.

**Visual:** Code review comments appear on screen.

Bad prompt: "Write a polite response to code review."

**Visual:** Result appears. Generic, stiff.

Better with few-shot: "Write a polite response to code review. Here's my style from previous responses:
1. 'Thanks for taking the time to review my work. I really appreciate the detailed feedback.'
2. 'Could you help me understand the comments about [specific function]? I want to make sure I'm on the right track.'
3. 'For the performance optimization suggestions, could you point me to any resources you'd recommend?'"

**Visual:** Better result appears. Personal, clear, shows you care about growth.

See the difference? The first one could be from anyone. The second one sounds like YOU.

---

### [6:00-7:00] CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT EXAMPLES IN ACTION
**Visual:** Host engaged, demonstrating real scenarios.

**Script:**
Now let me show you chain-of-thought in action with something you might face as a BTNE professional.

**Visual:** Host with interview prep scenario.

Scenario: You've got a technical interview for a mid-level dev role. You're nervous because you haven't interviewed in a while. You want to prepare, not just memorize answers.

**Visual:** Interview prompt appears.

Bad prompt: "Help me prepare for this interview for [role]."

**Visual:** Generic tips appear on screen. "Be confident. Arrive early. Ask good questions."

That's fine. But what if you prepared strategically? What if you thought through the process?

**Visual:** Chain-of-thought prompt appears.

Better with chain-of-thought: "I have a technical interview for [role] at [company]. First, analyze this job description and tell me the top 5 technical skills they're looking for. Second, for each skill, predict 3 specific questions they might ask and suggest example answers using my experience. Third, outline common behavioral questions and STAR method responses. Fourth, identify 3 questions I should ask them about team culture and growth opportunities. Finally, help me practice with a mock interview."

**Visual:** Structured, detailed prep appears.

See what happened? You're not just ready. You're STRATEGIC. You've thought through the process. You've anticipated what they might ask. You've prepared follow-up questions.

**Visual:** Host leans in.

This changes everything. When you walk in that interview room, you're not hoping for the best. You're ready for anything they throw at you.

---

### [7:00-8:00] ROLE-BASED EXAMPLES IN ACTION
**Visual:** Host with enthusiasm, showing role variety.

**Script:**
Role-based prompting is my favorite because it works for EVERYTHING. Let me show you three examples.

**Visual:** Host walking to different "roles."

**Visual:** Host in suit, tie.

Example one: Salary negotiation. You just got an offer. It's good but you think there's room for more. You want to be prepared but not greedy.

**Visual:** Salary negotiation prompt appears.

Bad prompt: "Help me negotiate my salary."

**Visual:** Generic negotiation tips appear.

Better with role-based: "You are a senior compensation analyst with 15 years of experience negotiating tech salaries. Help me negotiate a 20% increase on this offer of [salary]. First, research the market rate for this role and experience level in [location]. Second, prepare 3 data-backed arguments for why I deserve more based on my recent achievements. Third, anticipate 3 counter-offers they might make and prepare responses. Finally, give me a script that's confident but collaborative, not aggressive."

**Visual:** Detailed, professional negotiation strategy appears.

**Visual:** Host in hoodie, with coffee.

Example two: Presentation prep. You've got 15 minutes to present to leadership. The topic? Your project's progress. They're technical but might not remember details.

**Visual:** Presentation prompt appears.

Bad prompt: "Help me prepare my presentation."

**Visual:** Generic slides appear.

Better with role-based: "You are a VP of Engineering at a tech company who reviews quarterly project presentations. Help me prepare a 15-minute update on [project]. First, structure the presentation into: progress summary, key achievements since last quarter, upcoming milestones, and next quarter priorities. Second, design 5 slides with one key takeaway each—focus on data, not words. Third, prepare 3 potential questions from leadership and data-driven answers. Fourth, create a one-page handout with technical details. Finally, give me a 2-minute practice run-through."

**Visual:** Structured, executive-ready presentation appears.

**Visual:** Host in casual clothes.

Example three: Learning something new fast. Your team just adopted a new tool. You need to get up to speed. Quick. Like, this weekend.

**Visual:** Learning prompt appears.

Bad prompt: "Teach me [tool]."

**Visual:** Generic documentation appears.

Better with role-based: "You are a hands-on technical trainer who specializes in getting people productive with new tools quickly. Teach me [tool] for a professional like me. First, give me the 5 most common workflows I'll actually use in my role. Second, for each workflow, show me step-by-step how to do it with real examples. Third, give me 3 pro tips that aren't in the documentation but experienced users swear by. Fourth, give me a 30-day learning plan to master it. Finally, identify 3 common mistakes beginners make and how to avoid them."

**Visual:** Practical, role-specific learning path appears.

**Visual:** Host back at desk, smiling.

Role-based prompting works because you're not asking for generic help. You're asking someone specific. Someone with expertise. Someone who's walked in your shoes. Someone who knows what you actually need.

---

### [8:00-9:00] PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
**Visual:** Host engaged, connecting concepts.

**Script:**
Let me show you how these techniques work together in real BTNE life.

**Visual:** Host with "real project" scenario.

Imagine this scenario: You're a mid-level engineer at a Black tech company. You want to propose a new project to your manager. This is high-stakes. If you nail it, it could mean your next promotion.

**Visual:** Project proposal prompt appears on screen.

Let me write this prompt using all three techniques together.

**Visual:** Host types on screen.

"Act as my manager. I'm proposing a new automation project. Use CRAFT to structure your response.

**Visual:** Prompt continues.

Context: My manager is [manager name], technical but focused on efficiency. Budget is [amount], timeline needs to be tight. She values innovation but needs data first.

**Visual:** Prompt continues.

Here's the project data from 3 similar companies I found:
1. Company A implemented [automation tool] and saw 40% efficiency gain
2. Company B's ROI was 300% in first year
3. Company C reduced manual work by 60 hours per month

**Visual:** Prompt continues.

My role: Lead this initiative. Define success metrics. Manage timeline. Deliver working prototype.

**Visual:** Prompt continues.

Action: Research tool options. Build proof of concept. Get stakeholder buy-in. Launch pilot. Measure results.

**Visual:** Prompt continues.

Format: Email for initial proposal. Deck for presentation. Demo for technical review. One-page summary for budget.

**Visual:** Prompt continues.

Tone: Confident but not overpromising. Data-driven but human. Show I've done my homework but open to feedback.

**Visual:** Host looks at camera.

See what happened? We used context by researching real data. We defined the role clearly. We specified actions with outcomes. We chose the right format. We matched the tone. And we made it human, not robotic.

**Visual:** Complete response appears on screen.

This isn't magic. It's just communication. But with AI, communication is your superpower.

---

### [9:00-9:30] YOUR ACTION PLAN
**Visual:** Host direct, actionable.

**Script:**
Alright, you've got three powerful techniques. You've seen them in action. You understand CRAFT. Now, what do you actually do?

**Visual:** Action checklist appears on screen.

**Step one: Audit your current prompts.**
Look at the prompts you're already using. Be honest. Which ones are working? Which ones suck? This baseline matters because you need to know where you're starting.

**Visual:** Prompt examples appear.

Bad: "Write me a blog post."
Better: "Write me a 1000-word blog post about prompt engineering for mid-level developers. Use a conversational tone like you're talking to a colleague over coffee. Include one real example of a technique saving time. End with a question to engage readers."

See the difference? Specificity, context, tone, audience.

**Step two: Pick one technique per use case.**
Don't try to use all three at once. That's overwhelming. Start with few-shot for your day-to-day emails. Use chain-of-thought for complex problems. Use role-based for learning and specialized tasks.

**Visual:** Use case matrix appears.

| Use Case | Best Technique | Why |
|-----------|----------------|-----|
| Emails, messages, social | Few-shot | Show your voice with examples |
| Debugging, analysis, research | Chain-of-thought | Break it down, show work |
| Learning, interviews, feedback | Role-based | Get expert perspective |

**Step three: Build your example library.**
Every time you get a great response, save the prompt. Every time you get a terrible response, save that too. Build your personal library. Copy it. Organize it by use case.

**Visual:** Example library appears.

This is the secret sauce. Because the first time you use few-shot for salary negotiation, it's hard. The tenth time? It's natural.

**Step four: Iterate and improve.**
Prompt engineering isn't set it and forget it. Review your results weekly. What worked well? What flopped? Double down on techniques that performed. Swap out techniques that didn't click.

**Visual:** Iteration cycle appears.

Track your success. Keep a simple log. "Used few-shot for LinkedIn post—views up 300%. Used role-based for interview—got the job." This data tells you what to double down on.

---
