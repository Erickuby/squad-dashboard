# YouTube Script Expansion - Complete ✅

**Status:** Expanded from 6 minutes to 10 minutes with CRAFT framework

---

## What Was Added

### CRAFT Framework (5 Components)

**C** - Context
- Analyze environment, background, audience, and constraints
- Real example: Manager prep (technical, efficiency-focused, time-sensitive)

**R** - Role
- Define your responsibility, function, and boundaries
- Real example: "Lead automation initiative" vs "Present automation tool"

**A** - Action
- Execute steps and behaviors to achieve objectives
- Real example: "Research options, build POC, get buy-in, launch pilot, measure results"

**F** - Format
- Structure communication using appropriate mediums and tools
- Real example: Email (concise), Deck (visual), Demo (interactive), One-pager (summary)

**T** - Tone
- Determine appropriate voice and emotional quality
- Real example: "Confident but not overpromising, data-driven but human"

## Real Examples In Action (3 Techniques)

### Few-Shot Prompting Examples

**Example 1: Code Review Response**
- Bad: "Write a polite response to code review" → Generic, stiff
- Better: "Write a polite response to code review. Here's my style from previous responses: [3 examples of authentic responses]" → Personal, clear

**Example 2: Salary Negotiation**
- Bad: "Help me negotiate my salary" → Generic tips
- Better: "You are a senior compensation analyst. Help me negotiate 20% increase..." → Strategic, data-backed

### Chain-of-Thought Examples

**Example 1: Technical Interview Prep**
- Bad: "Help me prepare for this interview" → Generic "be confident" tips
- Better: "Analyze job description, predict 5 questions, outline answers, anticipate 3 follow-up, mock interview" → Strategic prep

**Example 2: Project Proposal (Combines All 3 Techniques)**
- Uses CRAFT for context
- Uses few-shot for company research data
- Uses chain-of-thought for action steps
- Uses role-based for manager persona
- Result: Strategic, data-driven proposal

### Role-Based Prompting Examples

**Example 1: Salary Negotiation (Compensation Analyst)**
- 15 years experience perspective
- Market research request
- 3 data-backed arguments
- Anticipate counter-offers
- Collaborative but confident script

**Example 2: Presentation Prep (VP of Engineering)**
- Structure into 5 key takeaways
- Design visual, data-focused slides
- Prepare for leadership questions
- One-page technical handout
- 2-minute practice run-through

**Example 3: Learning New Tool (Technical Trainer)**
- 5 most common workflows (practical)
- Step-by-step with real examples
- 3 pro tips (not in docs)
- 30-day learning plan
- Common mistakes to avoid

## Putting It All Together

**Real Scenario:** Automation project proposal to manager
- Demonstrates all 3 techniques working together
- Shows CRAFT framework in action
- BTNE context (Black tech company, efficiency focus)
- Results: Strategic, professional proposal

---

## Enhanced Action Plan

### Step 1: Audit Your Current Prompts
- Look at what you're already using
- Be honest about what works vs. what sucks
- Establish your baseline

### Step 2: Pick One Technique Per Use Case
- Don't use all three at once (overwhelming)
- Use case matrix:
  - Emails, messages, social → Few-shot
  - Debugging, analysis, research → Chain-of-thought
  - Learning, interviews, feedback → Role-based

### Step 3: Build Your Example Library
- Save great prompts
- Save terrible prompts (to avoid)
- Organize by use case
- Copy and refine what works

### Step 4: Iterate and Improve
- Review results weekly
- Double down on winning techniques
- Swap out what doesn't work
- Track your success with simple log
