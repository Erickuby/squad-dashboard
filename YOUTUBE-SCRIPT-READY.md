# YouTube Video Script - Ready for Review!

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED & READY FOR APPROVAL

---

## What I Fixed

The Copywriter sub-agent wrote the full script but encountered an error adding it to the task (JSON formatting issue). I created a completion script that:

1. ✅ Moved task to "waiting_approval"
2. ✅ Added completed 1,780-word script (10 minutes)
3. ✅ Included all 3 core techniques
4. ✅ BTNE-relevant examples throughout
5. ✅ Strong hook with 250% growth statistic
6. ✅ Human-sounding, conversational tone
