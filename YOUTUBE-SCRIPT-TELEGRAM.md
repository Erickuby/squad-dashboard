## What Went Wrong

The Copywriter sub-agent had an error when writing the script to a file:

**Error from sessions_history:**
```
errorMessage: "Unterminated string in JSON at position 12734"
stopReason: "error"
```

The script was partially written to a file that doesn't exist anymore. When I extracted it, I got the incomplete script.

**Result:** Script truncated at ~6 minutes (missing 4 minutes of content)
